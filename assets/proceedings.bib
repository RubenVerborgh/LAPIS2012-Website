  abstract = {This paper will give an overview of the practical implications of the HATEOAS constraint of the REST architectural style, and in that light argue why hypermedia RDF is a practical necessity. We will then sketch a vocabulary for hypermedia RDF using Mike Amundsen's H Factor classification as motivator. Finally,we will briefly argue that SPARQL is important when making non-trivial traversals of Linked Data graphs, and see how to a bridge between Linked Data and SPARQL may be created with hypermedia RDF.},

  abstract = {The objective of new service modeling approaches introduced by recent work on linked services is to integrate Linked Data and service APIs. Building these models is time consuming and difficult, which is an obstacle preventing wide adoption of these modeling approaches. We introduce an approach to semi-automatically build semantic models of the Web APIs by using examples of input values. We use these values to invoke the service and then use the input and output values to learn a semantic model of an API. These models enable a system to easily integrate data and services and to export the models as Linked APIs.},

  abstract = {“Web~1.0 connected humans with machines. Web~2.0 connected humans with humans. Web~3.0 connects machines with machines.” On the one hand, an incredible amount of valuable data is described by billions of triples, machine-accessible and interconnected thanks to the promises of Linked Data. On the other hand, rest is a scalable, resource-oriented architectural style that, like the Linked Data vision, recognizes the importance of links between resources. Hypermedia APIs are resources, too—albeit dynamic ones—and unfortunately, neither Linked Data principles, nor the rest-implied self-descriptiveness of hypermedia APIs sufficiently describe them to allow for long-envisioned realizations like automatic service discovery and composition. We argue that describing inter-resource links—similarly to what the Linked Data movement has done for data—is the key to machine-driven consumption of APIs. In this paper, we explain how the description format RESTdesc captures the functionality of APIs by explaining the effect of dynamic interactions, effectively complementing the Linked Data vision.},

  abstract = {The Linked Data effort has been focusing on how to publish open data sets on the Web, and it has had great results. However, mechanisms for updating linked data sources have been neglected in research. We propose a structure for Linked Data resources into named graphs, connected through hyperlinks and self-described with light metadata, that is a natural match for using standard HTTP methods to implement application-specific (high-level) public update APIs.},
