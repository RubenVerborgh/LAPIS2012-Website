<h2>An essential problem in need of a&nbsp;fresh look</h2>
<h3>Services and the Semantic Web: it's complicated.</h3>

<p>
  The Semantic Web's relationship with services has been a&nbsp;long and complicated one.
  Many of the early service description efforts had a&nbsp;solid theoretical foundation, yet failed to find broad adoption.
  <br>
  The Web <strong>changed</strong> a&nbsp;lot since then, and so did the <strong>mindset</strong> of its researchers.
</p>

<p>
  Today, resource-oriented&nbsp;APIs or &ldquo;REST APIs&rdquo; are on the rise – and herein truly lies an <strong>important opportunity</strong> for the Semantic&nbsp;Web.
  Services no longer have to exist on a&nbsp;separate island, because the&nbsp;Semantic Web shares with these REST APIs the most essential feature of the Web: <strong>resources</strong>.
</p>

<h3> What is our answer, as a community, to this evolution?</h3>
<p>
  With this workshop, we aim to discover new ways to embrace the opportunities that resource-oriented APIs offer to the Semantic Web.
  We want to challenge researchers to <strong>think out of the current box</strong> through both <a href="/call-for-papers/"><strong>paper submissions</strong></a> and interactive on-site <strong>discussion and dialog</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Can links do for APIs what they did for the Semantic Web?</h3>

<p>
  The <strong>Linked Data</strong> movement has provided the Semantic Web with a&nbsp;powerful injection thanks to the <strong>power of links</strong>.
  Since REST APIs also center around resources, key questions for the workshop are:
  How can we enable <strong>Linked APIs</strong>?
  And how can they <strong>create added value</strong> for the Semantic Web?
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to submissions that tackle these and related important questions, by focusing on the specific nature of <strong>resource-oriented APIs</strong>, the <strong>functionality</strong> they bring, and their path to <strong>integration</strong>.
  <br>
  We also actively invite participants to <strong>discuss</strong> and <strong>challenge</strong> new ideas.
</p>

<h2>Workshop description and motivation</h2>
<p>
  The notion of Web services has been around since the beginning of the Web.
  When the Semantic&nbsp;Web community started evolving, it thus came as no surprise that people had the desire to work on the <strong>bridge between services and semantics</strong>, especially given the importance of services in various <strong>agent</strong> scenarios for the Semantic Web.
  Since SOAP and WSDL were the predominant service technologies at that time, researchers worked on describing their low-level technical details – such as parameters and exception handling – in semantic models, notably OWL-S and WSMO.
</p>

<p>
  When SOAP and WSDL turned out not to be a satisfying answer for a&nbsp;resource-oriented Web, providers shifted <strong>from&nbsp;Web services to resource-oriented APIs</strong>, commonly called REST or RESTful.
  In response, researchers ported the concept of describing low-level details to this new situation, giving rise to WADL, MicroWSMO, and others.
  <br>
  However, the ideas themselves were not questioned:
  can technical descriptions alone satisfy the vision and aspirations of the Semantic Web?
  New paradigms do not only demand <strong>new answers</strong>, but – more importantly – <strong>new questions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The questions we look for can be found in different sources.
  <br>
  One of them is the <strong>initial Semantic&nbsp;Web vision</strong>: what are the <strong>missing links</strong> to construct a&nbsp;Web for agents, given the Linked Data cloud and resource-oriented APIs?
  Another source stems from concrete <strong>business situations and needs</strong>: what&nbsp;do current resource-oriented APIs lack on a&nbsp;semantic level, and how can we provide this?
  <br>
  Clearly, these questions convey <strong>fundamental problems</strong> that have been neglected for too long.
