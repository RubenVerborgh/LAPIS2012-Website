##An essential problem in need of a&nbsp;fresh look
###Services and the Semantic Web: it's complicated.

The Semantic Web's relationship with services has been a&nbsp;long and complicated one.
Many of the early service description efforts had a&nbsp;solid theoretical foundation, yet failed to find broad adoption.  
The Web **changed** a&nbsp;lot since then, and so did the **mindset** of its researchers.

Today, resource-oriented&nbsp;APIs or &ldquo;REST APIs&rdquo; are on the rise – and herein truly lies an **important opportunity** for the Semantic&nbsp;Web.
Services no longer have to exist on a&nbsp;separate island, because the&nbsp;Semantic Web shares with these REST APIs the most essential feature of the Web: **resources**.

###What is our answer, as a community, to this evolution?
With this workshop, we aim to discover new ways to embrace the opportunities that resource-oriented APIs offer to the Semantic Web.
We want to challenge researchers to **think out of the current box** through both [**paper submissions**](/call-for-papers/) and interactive on-site **discussion and dialog**.

###Can links do for APIs what they did for the Semantic Web?
The **Linked Data** movement has provided the Semantic Web with a&nbsp;powerful injection thanks to the **power of links**.
Since REST APIs also center around resources, key questions for the workshop are:
How can we enable **Linked APIs**?
And how can they **create added value** for the Semantic Web?

We look forward to submissions that tackle these and related important questions, by focusing on the specific nature of **resource-oriented APIs**, the **functionality** they bring, and their path to **integration**.  
We also actively invite participants to **discuss** and **challenge** new ideas.

##Workshop description and motivation
The notion of Web services has been around since the beginning of the Web.
When the Semantic&nbsp;Web community started evolving, it thus came as no surprise that people had the desire to work on the **bridge between services and semantics**, especially given the importance of services in various **agent** scenarios for the Semantic Web.
Since SOAP and WSDL were the predominant service technologies at that time, researchers worked on describing their low-level technical details – such as parameters and exception handling – in semantic models, notably OWL-S and WSMO.

When SOAP and WSDL turned out not to be a satisfying answer for a&nbsp;resource-oriented Web, providers shifted **from&nbsp;Web services to resource-oriented APIs**, commonly called REST or RESTful.
In response, researchers ported the concept of describing low-level details to this new situation, giving rise to WADL, MicroWSMO, and others.  
However, the ideas themselves were not questioned:
can technical descriptions alone satisfy the vision and aspirations of the Semantic Web?
New paradigms do not only demand **new answers**, but – more importantly – **new questions**.

The questions we look for can be found in different sources.  
One of them is the **initial Semantic&nbsp;Web vision**: what are the **missing links** to construct a&nbsp;Web for agents, given the Linked Data cloud and resource-oriented APIs?
Another source stems from concrete **business situations and needs**: what&nbsp;do current resource-oriented APIs lack on a&nbsp;semantic level, and how can we provide this?  
Clearly, these questions convey **fundamental problems** that have been neglected for too long.
