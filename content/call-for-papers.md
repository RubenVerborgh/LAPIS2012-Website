#Call for Papers
##Goal of the LAPIS workshop
The main goal of the LAPIS workshop is to give birth to **new ideas and visions**, through presentations that encourage **interaction and discussion**.
Topics of discussion include:

- defining **Linked APIs**, what they could look like, and what role links can play
- identifying the **essential building blocks** for enabling Linked APIs
- pinpointing challenges to **move from resource-oriented APIs** towards Linked APIs
- capturing **added value** of Linked APIs for the Semantic Web and REST communities
- designing applications by **connecting Linked Data** and Linked APIs for reading and writing

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be **creative**.

##Submission opportunities
###Regular paper
Regular papers focus on **new ideas or technologies** you have developed that relate to Linked&nbsp;APIs.  
We are very **open-minded** towards the workshop scope, and expect the same from you.

Be **original**. Be **creative**. But most of all: be at least a&nbsp;*little* controversial – **generate discussion**.  
We're not looking for the next Big Invention.
Workshop participants want to discover and to learn.

Your submission consists of two parts:

- a&nbsp;**paper** in LNCS style of maximum 8&nbsp;pages
- a&nbsp;list of **1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;questions** related to your paper to discuss with the participants

###Vision paper
Vision papers focus on **creative ideas and concepts**, even if there are no concrete results yet.  
Having more questions than answers can in fact be a plus… if you find **the right questions**.

Your submission consists of two parts:

- a&nbsp;**paper** in LNCS style of maximum 4&nbsp;pages
- a&nbsp;list of **1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;questions** related to your vision paper to discuss with the participants

###Wild ideas and discussion starters
Besides the traditional papers component, we would also like to run an **experiment**.  
We want your wildest ideas and discussion topics to make LAPIS&nbsp;2012 an interactive workshop.

Your submission can be either of the following:

- a&nbsp;one-sentence thought-provoking statement
- a&nbsp;one-paragraph idea or discussion topic

There's **no limit** to the amount of submissions for this experimental component, so **get crazy**!
